	// Place your global snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and 
	// description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope 
	// is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is 
	// used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are: 
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. 
	// Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"scope": "php",
		"prefix": "function_new_SQL",
		"body": [
			"function $1FUNCTION_NAME() {",
			"\tglobal $$call;",
			"\t// global $$globconn;",

			"",	
			"\t// echo $$sql1;",
			"\t// return;",
			"",
